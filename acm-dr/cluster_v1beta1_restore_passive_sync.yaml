# apply this resource to restore hub resources in a passive configuration
# and keeps checking for new backups and restore if updates are available
# restored managed clusters will not show on the current hub, where this resource is applied

######
# syncRestoreWithNewBackups - enable this restore and keep checking for new backups and restore if updates are available.
#                             For this option to work, you need to set VeleroResourcesBackupName and VeleroCredentialsBackupName to latest
#                             and set VeleroManagedClustersBackupName to skip (as soon as the cluster activation data is latest, the restore is completed)
#                             If not defined, the value is set to false.

# If veleroManagedClustersBackupName is set to latest after this restore resource has been Enabled, 
# managed clusters activation data is restored and this resource status changes to finished.
# 

# restoreSyncInterval - defines the duration for checking on new backups 
#                       If not defined and SyncRestoreWithNewBackups is set to true, it defaults to 30m
#####

# cleanupBeforeRestore - required, asks to clean up cluster after applying restore
# valid options : 
# CleanupRestored - clean up resources created by a previous acm restore and not part of the currently restored backup
# None : don't clean up anything, just apply the restore
